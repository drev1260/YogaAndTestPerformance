* **Condition:** The condition the participants were placed in. Participants were placed in one of two conditions: "yoga"" or "nature." Conditions were determined for each participant by the last digit of the time of the clock at the time of the experiment; Odd numbers were put into one condition and evens were put into the other.

* **Low stress:** Participants were asked to report their level of stress at the time of the experiment: 1) No stress, 2) Low stress, 3) Moderate stress, or 4) High stress. In our data analysis we condenced the participants into two groups. We put those who reported 1 or 2 (No stress or little stress) into a "Low stress" category and those who reported 3 or 4 (Moderate stress or high stress) into a "high stress" category.

* **High Stress:** Participants were asked to report their level of stress at the time of the experiment: 1) No stress, 2) Low stress, 3) Moderate stress, or 4) High stress. In our data analysis we condenced the participants into two groups. We put those who reported 1 or 2 (No stress or little stress) into a "Low stress" category and those who reported 3 or 4 (Moderate stress or high stress) into a "high stress" category.

* **Score:** The score for each participant is the number or correct answers out of the 24 questions on the timed math text section of the experiment. There were 25 questions on the test, but for one the answer on the scoring page was reported incorrectly and therefore excluded from analysis.
